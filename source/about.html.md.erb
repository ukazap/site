ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to *Programming & Lollygagging*, a weblog by **Ukaza Perdana**.

I make software to bring joy to others. I am a [rubyist](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) who have extensive knowledge of web app development. I write web scrapers and automation scripts for fun and/or profit.

I'm a senior [software developer (backend)](https://github.com/ukazap) at [Melalie](https://www.melalie.com) in Bali, Indonesia (check it out, it's awesome). Previously I worked at [Jurnal](https://www.jurnal.id/en/) as a full-stack web developer.

My foray into the world of programming started when I was in secondary school, I learned to build my calculator using VB6. Along the way, I learned x86, Pascal, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP, and Python before using Ruby professionally. Initially I was considering a career in game development, however, I settled on web development after watching [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson)'s lectures on his vision of interconnected information. In the future, I hope to develop my hobbyist operating system.

I was born and raised in Kediri, East Java. I speak Indonesian, Javanese, English, and a bit of Hokkien.

When I don't code, I play video games, watch indie movies, listen to metal, hike, or sleep.
