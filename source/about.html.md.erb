# About Me

<%= image_tag 'ukz.jpg', width: 100 %>

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to *Programming & Lollygagging*, a web log by **Ukaza Perdana**.

I make softwares to bring joy to others. I have an extensive knowledge of web app development and a diehard [Rubyist](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I write web scrapers and automation scripts for fun and profit.

I'm a [Senior Software Engineer (Backend)](https://github.com/ukazap) at [Melalie](https://www.melalie.com) in Bali, Indonesia (check it out, it's awesome). Prior to moving to Bali I worked in a [cool fintech company](https://www.jurnal.id/en/).

I was born and raised in Kediri, a modest city in East Java, previously the epicenter of Javanese civilization. I speak Indonesian, Javanese, English, and a bit of Hokkien.

When I don't code, I play video games, watch indie movies, listen to metal, hike, or sleep.
